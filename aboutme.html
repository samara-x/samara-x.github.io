      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Samara! I’m currently undertaking the SheCodes Plus six-month
        full-stack development course, where I’m currently attempting to build a
        strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and backend
        technologies. My goal is to combine my technical skills with my
        background in leadership and change to create meaningful, user-focused
        solutions. I come from a professional background where I’ve led teams,
        mentored others, and driven organisational change using structured
        models. Currently a Superintendent within a major rail project, shaping
        training processes, promoting a safe workplace culture, and ensuring
        operational readiness. This experience has taught me the importance of
        clear communication, collaboration, and building scalable systems -
        skills I now bring into my coding journey. I’m passionate about
        problem-solving, designing intuitive interfaces, and creating technology
        that empowers people. Outside of work and coding, I enjoy exploring
        creative projects and challenging myself with new ways of thinking. My
        portfolio is a space to share my coding journey, document my progress,
        and showcase the projects I’m most proud of. Let’s connect — I’m always
        excited to collaborate and bring new ideas to life!
